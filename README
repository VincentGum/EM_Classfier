This is a simple class for EM algorithm

1, set your initial clusters' centers typed np.array, and put all the centers in a list(c_init);
2, read the training data, drop the column 'user_id' and take the values as training data(np.array)
3, new a EM class:

    'em = EM.EM(data.values, c_init, MAX_ITER, EPSILON)'
    c_init: initial centers for each cluster list[np.array, np.array...]
    MAX_ITER: default=50
    EPSILON: default=0.001

4, use method 'train' to train the model:

    'em.train()'

   then you will see the training information popping out.

5, after the training, you can check the model information:

    'em.CURR_CEN' for the final clusters' centers.
    'em.LAST_CEN' for the clusters' centers before the final one.
    'em.iteration' for the times it train the model
    'em.CLUSTERS' for the final output of clustering, containing labels for all the objects
    'em.SSE' for SSE value for every iteration
